Chapter 2
=========
Ability to insert tables is added.

JS Concepts
1. Objects passed by reference
  a. putting record in records[] and idIndex{} doesn't duplicate record
2. Fail early: check inputs to catch bugs early in testing and not in production
3. Arrays vs. Objects.

Syntax
1. Backtick string interpolation
2. Throwing errors
3. Dynamic object keys table[name] (too simple?)
